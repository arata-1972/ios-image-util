ios-image-util
==============

OVERVIEW:
---------
This tiny Java application generate all size of icon & launch image files with PNG format for various version of iOS.
Support devices - iPhone, iPad and optionally supports Apple Watch, CarPlay, Mac.
"Asset Catalogs(Image Set)" is also supported.

![alt text](https://raw.github.com/gootara-org/ios-image-util/master/ios-image-util/docs/screen.png "GUI")

To generate images, just drop original icon PNG file (1024 x 1024 pixels recommended) to the window and press "Generate" button.
Scaled images will be generated automatically with appropriate filename.
For compatibility maintenance, iOS 6 icon can specify separately, but usually does not need to set for it.
Also icon and launch images especially for iPad can be specified. (If not specified, same images as iPhone will be applied.)

Optionally, Apple Watch, CarPlay and Mac icon can specify separately, too.
These are not requirement. You should set these images only when you want to generate.
*Icon for Apple Watch will be generated to 24 bits RGB PNG, without alpha channel.

The launch images are also optional.
A square PNG file (1536 x 1536 pixels recommended) is suitable for the launch image set.
The original picture gonna be put in the center of each size of launch images. (Some scaling options are available.)
Normally, the background-color will be guessed automatically, but also can be specified.
1536 x 1536 square shape is not a requirement, but it's easy way to generate universal launch images.

Each settings can be specified by using command line options.
This means generating process can be automated by using command line options with no gui.

The XML property file is supported.
You can store properties to the XML file and load it on next execution.
How to load XML - use menu or drop to the upper half of window or command-line options.
Individual command-line options are stronger than XML property file.

Moreover, from Ver 2.0, restore last settings at the next startup.
Settings can clear or reset by using command-line options.
Also, it's possible to clear settings completely by deleting 'ios-image-util.properties' file that the last settings stored.
This means the last settings will not be restored when executing by jar file from other directories.



As the extra feature, to generate @3x, @2x, @1x images from one PNG file.
(To drop/select multiple files are supported.)

From Ver 2.0, Image Set with Size Class is supported.

![alt text](https://raw.github.com/gootara-org/ios-image-util/master/ios-image-util/docs/splitter2.png "Splitter")

All of Size Class image files and Contents.json will be automatically generated
by simply dropping an original picture to the window.
Also, it's possible to specify output image size of all images individually.

In addition, from Ver 2.0, update checker is supported.
It can be turned off if you don't need it.
(Only available with executing from jar file)

*This application will not support "Brand Assets". (In other words, Apple TV icons are not supported.)
 Also will not support "Memory" and "Graphics" properties of Image Set.
 These are available with Xcode 7 or later.
